# EECE5690
Project space for EECE5690 Final Project

Database created using Python, storing data on MySQL. For the website, it is being hosted on AWS S3 (free), and I'm using Amazon RDS to store my database in the cloud for website access (free). The backend of the website is done on AWS itself through the use of Lambda's and an API Gateway.
